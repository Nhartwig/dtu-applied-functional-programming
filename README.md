    When using the VSCode IDE, to run F# scripts (.fsx) making use of the WinForms GUI toolkit go to Settings -> Search   "FSharp: Use Sdk Scripts" -> ensure this option is unchecked. 
    This ensures VSCode can run .fsx scripts with WinForms functionality - particularly our DialogueProgramMono.fsx script.
    
  Note: With this setting, fsi.exe will complain if you try to run a script that has empty lines with whitespace.
